These contracts provide a wide variety of local telecoms services to hundreds of locations, both CONUS and OCONUS.  In May 2023, these contracts will expire and GSA has announced that they are getting out of the local services business and will no longer provide a full service offering. Government agencies, to include the United States Coast Guard (USCG), are required to find adequate replacement of expiring contracts and transition all services to new contracts and carriers by the deadline of September 2022 so that GSA can close out contracts by May 2023.

Services obtained under this contract may be of any duration required by the Government. The requirement of this contract is to have technical standards and service levels equivalent to those of the GSA Networx, Regional LSAs and WITS3 contracts currently in place. This includes technical requirements, connectivity, features, standards, ordering, billing, inventory, network management and provisioning.

This high volume of cases, in addition to the exponentially large number of unknown files associated with each case, requires a large amount of time and manpower to analyze and validate each file.  TSA needs a solution that automates the investigators ability to query unknown files for potential malicious content.  This solution will enable existing security toolsets utilized by TSA to integrate into an online database of malware and conduct automated searches, freeing more time for the investigator to focus on an investigation.  This will also allow the Computer Network Defense Branch to proactively monitor for malware alerts triggered by the integrated security toolsets.

ERO upholds America's immigration laws at, within, and beyond our borders through efficient enforcement operations.  Enforcement operations include five operational phases (i.e., identify, apprehend, manage custody, process case, and remove) and two oversight/administrative phases (i.e., track and manage).
 To accomplish its mission today, ERO relies on multiple information systems, databases, spreadsheets, and paper-based solutions to navigate within and across phases. Although some ERO information systems interface with partner systems in the Immigration Enterprise, Deportation Officers are routinely forced to re-enter case information over the course of the immigration lifecycle.  Redundant data entry introduces process inefficiencies and data quality issues that exacerbate operational and reporting challenges.","Q3 2023","03/10/2023","04/21/2022",""

 Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the CBP Office of Finance (OF) Audit Oversight and Internal Controls Division (AOICD), supports the CBP Chief Financial Officer’s (CFO) implementation and assessment of internal controls over financial reporting and financial management, as well as external audit oversight and related audit remediation efforts.  These activities include meeting the requirements of the CFO Act, Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-123 and A-136, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), the DHS Financial Accountability Act (DHS FAA), the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), the Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act, and other statutes, regulations, and DHS requirements governing financial management and internal controls. 
 
 A significant requirement of the DHS FAA is the requirement for the Department to include the Secretary’s assertion of, and an independent audit opinion of, its Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICOFR) within its Performance and Accountability Report 
 
 AOICD’s principal actions and deliverables to meet these requirements include executing quarterly Test of Design (TOD) and Test of Operating Effectiveness (TOE) reviews of CBP’s ICOFR, preparation and maintenance of CBP’s Fraud Risk Register, and ongoing support to program offices within CBP to remediate control gaps and deficiencies identified through this process.
 
 Further, AOICD provides audit oversight of the annual external audit over CBP’s financial reporting and related internal controls.  This oversight includes accompaniment of external audit personnel on site visits, coordination of interviews and information requests, mediation, and follow-up actions to ensure clear communication, development of accurate and clear findings and recommendations, development of actionable remediation plans, remediation verification and validation, and tracking the closures of fully remediated audit findings.
 
 Additionally, AOICD also supports CBP financial risk management activities by providing actionable information, research, and analysis to senior leadership for decision-making intended to reduce mission risk and make the best use of limited resources. 
 
 Office of Information (OIT) works with AOICD in support of these activities in a similar fashion. 
 
 AOICD and OIT provide support in the following capacities: 
 
 •	Monitoring internal and external assessments and audits identifying financial and operational related risk
 •	Leads CBP wide assessments of internal controls over financial reporting and conformance with federal financial management systems requirements
 •	Supports the CFO in overseeing and coordinating internal control assessments over operational areas and information technology
 •	Maintains a portfolio of risk issues and provides decision-making tools and information enabling senior management to score, prioritize and identify areas for reducing financial risk
 •	Coordinates the development and implementation of remediation plans to resolve material weaknesses and other significant deficiency conditions
 •	Provides guidance and standards to support the CBP Commissioner’s year-end Internal Control Assurance Statement

 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for administering a variety of immigration benefits including permanent resident status, work permits, naturalization (citizenship), international adoptions, student visas, Temporary Protected Status, asylum, and refugee status. Applicants make a formal request to USCIS by filing an application with an established processing fee and appropriate documentation. USCIS provides applicants with immigration and related services to support the legal and regulatory requirements of the application process through ite headquarters, regional and district offices, service centers, and application support centers. Once an applicant is approved, the applicant is issued a document, All issued documents with the exception of the Naturalization Certificate have an expiration date. Applicants must re-apply at specified intervals to renew documents and continue immigration benefits. One of USCIS' primary responsibilities is to administer and manage Application Support Centers (ASCs) and related operations. ASCs collect applicant biometric and biographical data (e.g. digital fingerprints, photographs, and signatures). the data is used to conduct criminal background checks prior to USCIS making a determination whether to grant immigration benefits to applicants. Additional support functions are likely as USCIS continues to grow and evolve. This procurement is a continuation of the Application Support Center (ASC) program established in 1997 which is currently under the Identity and Information Management Division (IIMD) within the USCIS Immigration Records and Identity Services (IRIS) Directorate of USCIS.","Q3 2023","10/17/2022","07/14/2022","07/12/2022"

CBP’s facility portfolio for this project includes CBP-owned and long-term leased facilities. These facilities represent approximately 2.4 million square feet of facility space. The CBP facilities were selected as viable candidates for enhancements because the utility bill for each of these facilities exceeds $5,000 annually. CBP is interested in innovative technology solutions and management approaches for upgrading and installing equipment at these CBP facilities. The portfolio includes some of CBP’s largest facilities as well as many geographically dispersed, remote, and relatively small facilities.
 ESCOs must have experience developing and implementing ECMs, incorporating these technologies. Expression of Interest responses must therefore address CBP’s objectives for this project presented below:
 a.	Innovative solutions to reduce the cost of site travel throughout all phases of the project.
 b.	Turnkey ECMs that require minimal on-site operation and maintenance support. Proposed ECMs must be able to be easily used and maintained by onsite personnel that do not have facility management backgrounds (particularly for smaller facilities that do not have onsite professional facility managers).
 c.	Solutions that minimize O&M requirements and expenses including spare parts that are not costly and time consuming for small and remote facilities to maintain.  
 The three (3) tasks are detailed below. ESCOs shall address each task in their EOI response.
 a. ESPC ENABLE
