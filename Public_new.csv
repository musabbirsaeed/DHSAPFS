 2.  Must be built around a comprehensive set of Application Programming Interfaces (API) and native clients (e.g., Python, Java, C# (pronounced C-Sharp)) so it’s easily accessible from any of our applications enterprise-wide;
 3.  Must use the APIs cited in requirement number 2 for building powerful interfaces and analytic capabilities (e.g., Graph and Machine Learning);
 4.  Must be priced for performance (not data) and allow ingestion and analysis of ALL of our data;
 5.  Must allow the breakdown of data silos and make the critical data available, instantly, across the enterprise in an entirely open fashion;
 6.  Must provide training, maintenance and support;
 7.  Volume pricing can create decision points about which data is most important and which data can be overlooked, therefore, the solution must be cost effective;
 8.  Must be an open source software that is driven by a vibrant and active community, ensuring rapid and continued innovation based upon market feedback;
 9.  Must be a software based solution;
 10.  Critical and advanced capabilities must be available with an annual subscription that is easy to install and include Security, Enterprise management, Alerting, Graph analysis, and Machine learning;

TSA employs over 50,000 employees and maintains approximately 40,000 IT assets which results in a consistently high number of cases that need review.  This high volume of cases, in addition to the exponentially large number of unknown files associated with each case, requires a large amount of time and manpower to analyze and validate each file.  TSA needs a solution that automates the investigators ability to query unknown files for potential malicious content.  This solution will enable existing security toolsets utilized by TSA to integrate into an online database of malware and conduct automated searches, freeing more time for the investigator to focus on an investigation.  This will also allow the Computer Network Defense Branch to proactively monitor for malware alerts triggered by the integrated security toolsets.
 
 TSA requires the following three items for subscription-based access in support of malicious files and URL investigation and threat hunting:  
 
 1)	Virus Total Enterprise Subscription and API licenses supporting:

 The Office of Trade (OT) within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the Government office responsible for administering the CBLE. The specific responsibility is with the Broker Management Branch. In compliance with 19 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § of Customs and related laws, regulations and procedures, bookkeeping, accounting, and all other appropriate matters. By regulation, the exam is to be administered twice a year, on the fourth Wednesday in April and in October, unless the regularly scheduled date conflicts with a national holiday, religious observance, or other foreseeable event and the agency publishes in the Federal Register an appropriate notice of a change in the examination date.

 The installation shall include completing all low voltage wiring, device installation, system programming, and system testing involving four (4) separate security systems that encompass the ESS:
 
 -	Access Control System (ACS)
 -	Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
 -	Video Management System (VMS)
 -	Audio Monitoring System (AMS)
 
 The contractor must be able to plan for and acquire all necessary components for each system to complete a turnkey installation while keeping pace with the overall construction schedule for the new office space and gym. This is an active construction project, so the contractor must be able to start work upon award of the contract.
 
 The project requires a contractor who is a certified installer and has at least five (5) years of experience installing the following commercial systems:
 
 - Hirsch/Identiv FICAM ACS
 - Bosch G Series IDS
 - Axis Communications Internet Protocol VMS
 
 Each system (except for the AMS) will require at least thirty (30) end of line components with the IDS involving more than sixty (60) devices. The contractor must be able to complete all work to fully install these devices within a four (4) week time period in early 2022. The project also involves the installation of all network and workstation hardware, to include the furnishing of a rack with appropriate back-up power supply inside a computer equipment room.
 
 The project requires experience integrating fiber-optic cable with a CAT6 network.
 
 The project will require a substantial number of written deliverables to include equipment lists, comprehensive plans for installation and testing, a quality control plan, as-built drawings, cable management plans, and network topologies. To accomplish this and the entire ESS installation, the government will require the contractor to employ the following key personnel:
 
 -	Project Manager  
 -	Systems Security Engineer
 -	Lead Installer
 
 Once delivery is accepted by the government, there is a requirement for the contractor to provide a one (1) year warranty period on all systems.
 
 The only potential cost effectiveness issues are related to equipment lead times due to chip shortages.  Currently the lead time is approximately 8 weeks for delivery and the prices may be higher if the vendor is able to provide items sooner.
 
 This requirement is a component of an overall buildout of the Green FOB and to ensure that the overall project milestones remain on track, this contact must be awarded no later than December 1, 2021. This award timeframe will ensure that the vendor is able to meet the long lead times for the equipment and have it delivered in time to begin the work.","Q3 2022","05/25/2022","03/25/2022",""

The goal of the Time and Motion Study is to evaluate work processes and establish baseline performance metrics. This involves documenting workflows, breaking down tasks into components, collecting data on work either in real time or from administrative records (as available). The Staffing Allocation Model uses data obtained from the Time & Motion Study, along with forecasts of workload volumes, utilization rates, policy changes, etc., to predict staffing needs.
 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)/Privacy Act (PA) Program is administered by Immigration Records and Identity Services (IRIS) Directorate, National Records Center (NRC). Through the FOIA/PA Program external customers are provided access to agency records in accordance with the applicable statutes.  The FOIA program relies on knowledgeable operational staff to create, process and approve cases consistent with statute and regulations.
 
 Staffing Allocation Models have been used successfully in USCIS and elsewhere to justify program specific and mission support staffing levels. As with any model, however, the quality of a Staffing Allocation Model is limited by the quality of the data inputs to the model. The data inputs include information about workflows, workloads, workload drivers, tasks, and key performance metrics, such as time to accomplish specific tasks, utilization rates, and workload volumes. While many organizations have historical information about staffing and workload volumes, timing information (e.g., Completion Times) is often harder to come by. A Time and Motion Study can provide quality time measurements and other information about workflows and work processes that can help ensure a solid foundation of data inputs for a Staffing Allocation Model.
 
 USCIS has already identified an 8(a) vendor for this requirement.","Q4 2022","06/15/2022","05/06/2022",""
