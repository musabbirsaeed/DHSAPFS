These contracts provide a wide variety of local telecoms services to hundreds of locations, both CONUS and OCONUS.  In May 2023, these contracts will expire and GSA has announced that they are getting out of the local services business and will no longer provide a full service offering. Government agencies, to include the United States Coast Guard (USCG), are required to find adequate replacement of expiring contracts and transition all services to new contracts and carriers by the deadline of September 2022 so that GSA can close out contracts by May 2023.

USCG requires “like-for-like” replacement, technologically-equivalent or comparable transformation of services at all its locations in addition to ordering, provisioning, billing, inventory, and 24/7 customer service support for life-cycle management. Services obtained under this contract may be of any duration required by the Government. The requirement of this contract is to have technical standards and service levels equivalent to those of the GSA Networx, Regional LSAs and WITS3 contracts currently in place. This includes technical requirements, connectivity, features, standards, ordering, billing, inventory, network management and provisioning. USCG will require a fully-operational, functional and robust contractor’s commercial Operational System (OS). USCG intends to prepare, issue, and manage orders, billing and inventory electronically in the designated vendors online web portal (OS).

TSA employs over 50,000 employees and maintains approximately 40,000 IT assets which results in a consistently high number of cases that need review.  This high volume of cases, in addition to the exponentially large number of unknown files associated with each case, requires a large amount of time and manpower to analyze and validate each file.  TSA needs a solution that automates the investigators ability to query unknown files for potential malicious content.  This solution will enable existing security toolsets utilized by TSA to integrate into an online database of malware and conduct automated searches, freeing more time for the investigator to focus on an investigation.  This will also allow the Computer Network Defense Branch to proactively monitor for malware alerts triggered by the integrated security toolsets.
 
 TSA requires the following three items for subscription-based access in support of malicious files and URL investigation and threat hunting:  
 
 1)	Virus Total Enterprise Subscription and API licenses supporting:

By regulation, the exam is to be administered twice a year, on the fourth Wednesday in April and in October, unless the regularly scheduled date conflicts with a national holiday, religious observance, or other foreseeable event and the agency publishes in the Federal Register an appropriate notice of a change in the examination date.

 The installation shall include completing all low voltage wiring, device installation, system programming, and system testing involving four (4) separate security systems that encompass the ESS:
 
 -	Access Control System (ACS)
 -	Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
 -	Video Management System (VMS)
 -	Audio Monitoring System (AMS)
 
 The contractor must be able to plan for and acquire all necessary components for each system to complete a turnkey installation while keeping pace with the overall construction schedule for the new office space and gym. This is an active construction project, so the contractor must be able to start work upon award of the contract.
 
 The project requires a contractor who is a certified installer and has at least five (5) years of experience installing the following commercial systems:
 
 - Hirsch/Identiv FICAM ACS
 - Bosch G Series IDS
 - Axis Communications Internet Protocol VMS
 
 Each system (except for the AMS) will require at least thirty (30) end of line components with the IDS involving more than sixty (60) devices. The contractor must be able to complete all work to fully install these devices within a four (4) week time period in early 2022. The project also involves the installation of all network and workstation hardware, to include the furnishing of a rack with appropriate back-up power supply inside a computer equipment room.
 
 The project requires experience integrating fiber-optic cable with a CAT6 network.
 
 The project will require a substantial number of written deliverables to include equipment lists, comprehensive plans for installation and testing, a quality control plan, as-built drawings, cable management plans, and network topologies. To accomplish this and the entire ESS installation, the government will require the contractor to employ the following key personnel:
 
 -	Project Manager  
 -	Systems Security Engineer
 -	Lead Installer
 
 Once delivery is accepted by the government, there is a requirement for the contractor to provide a one (1) year warranty period on all systems.
 
 The only potential cost effectiveness issues are related to equipment lead times due to chip shortages.  Currently the lead time is approximately 8 weeks for delivery and the prices may be higher if the vendor is able to provide items sooner.
 
 This requirement is a component of an overall buildout of the Green FOB and to ensure that the overall project milestones remain on track, this contact must be awarded no later than December 1, 2021. This award timeframe will ensure that the vendor is able to meet the long lead times for the equipment and have it delivered in time to begin the work.","Q3 2022","05/25/2022","03/25/2022",""

These new technologies apply a single component binders using ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) manufactured from recycled tires.  Using these technologies and products provide warranties between 3-10 years for top coating asphalt. It is recommended that filling all existing asphalt cracks with rubber emulsion single component products will ensure bonding on the side walls and top coating will seal the entire asphalt pavement deck.
 
 The concrete at the entrance of the station, fuel island and at the curbs is broken and uneven. In addition, the concrete pads are showing a degradation of the urethane joint compound, erosion of the concrete surface in some areas and exposure of the base materials.  This situation potentially can cause water to wash under the pads and erode the sub-base materials. Griding the uneven concrete and sealing the joints will prevent further degradation and prevent the potential failure of the concrete pavement. Concrete pad that are already eroded would require removal and new concrete pads poured in.  
 
 The pavements at these ECJ area locations are subject to the enhanced deteriorations if not fixed under this project.  The contractor who will win the contract will be encouraged to provide their professional recommendations or alternatives concerning design, contingencies, products, and systems, during the site-walk.

The goal of the Time and Motion Study is to evaluate work processes and establish baseline performance metrics. This involves documenting workflows, breaking down tasks into components, collecting data on work either in real time or from administrative records (as available). The Staffing Allocation Model uses data obtained from the Time & Motion Study, along with forecasts of workload volumes, utilization rates, policy changes, etc., to predict staffing needs.
 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)/Privacy Act (PA) Program is administered by Immigration Records and Identity Services (IRIS) Directorate, National Records Center (NRC). Through the FOIA/PA Program external customers are provided access to agency records in accordance with the applicable statutes.  The FOIA program relies on knowledgeable operational staff to create, process and approve cases consistent with statute and regulations.
 
 Staffing Allocation Models have been used successfully in USCIS and elsewhere to justify program specific and mission support staffing levels. As with any model, however, the quality of a Staffing Allocation Model is limited by the quality of the data inputs to the model. The data inputs include information about workflows, workloads, workload drivers, tasks, and key performance metrics, such as time to accomplish specific tasks, utilization rates, and workload volumes. While many organizations have historical information about staffing and workload volumes, timing information (e.g., Completion Times) is often harder to come by. A Time and Motion Study can provide quality time measurements and other information about workflows and work processes that can help ensure a solid foundation of data inputs for a Staffing Allocation Model.

CBP’s facility portfolio for this project includes CBP-owned and long-term leased facilities. These facilities represent approximately 2.4 million square feet of facility space. The CBP facilities were selected as viable candidates for enhancements because the utility bill for each of these facilities exceeds $5,000 annually. CBP is interested in innovative technology solutions and management approaches for upgrading and installing equipment at these CBP facilities. The portfolio includes some of CBP’s largest facilities as well as many geographically dispersed, remote, and relatively small facilities.
 ESCOs must have experience developing and implementing ECMs, incorporating these technologies. Expression of Interest responses must therefore address CBP’s objectives for this project presented below:
 a.	Innovative solutions to reduce the cost of site travel throughout all phases of the project.
 b.	Turnkey ECMs that require minimal on-site operation and maintenance support. Proposed ECMs must be able to be easily used and maintained by onsite personnel that do not have facility management backgrounds (particularly for smaller facilities that do not have onsite professional facility managers).
 c.	Solutions that minimize O&M requirements and expenses including spare parts that are not costly and time consuming for small and remote facilities to maintain.  
 The three (3) tasks are detailed below. ESCOs shall address each task in their EOI response.
 a. ESPC ENABLE
 b. Cost Wise Readiness - Essential Lighting 
 c. Climate and Energy Resilience - PV and battery energy storage

A geocoder enables the conversion of addresses to geographic coordinates. The geographic coordinates are a key requirement for performing analysis on the data. The different types of analysis can include location analysis of persons of interest, ICE resources, and ICE personnel allocations by geography. Geocoded address data also support other analysis such as proximity, spatial correlation, and link. ESRI’s ArcGIS World Geocoder software maps global addresses quickly and accurately behind the firewall. Global enterprises can input addresses from around the world and put them on a map using one single locator.
