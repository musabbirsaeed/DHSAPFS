These contracts provide a wide variety of local telecoms services to hundreds of locations, both CONUS and OCONUS.  In May 2023, these contracts will expire and GSA has announced that they are getting out of the local services business and will no longer provide a full service offering. Government agencies, to include the United States Coast Guard (USCG), are required to find adequate replacement of expiring contracts and transition all services to new contracts and carriers by the deadline of September 2022 so that GSA can close out contracts by May 2023.

The requirement of this contract is to have technical standards and service levels equivalent to those of the GSA Networx, Regional LSAs and WITS3 contracts currently in place. This includes technical requirements, connectivity, features, standards, ordering, billing, inventory, network management and provisioning.

These ocean buoys are continually lost or destroyed due to collisions with passing vessels, extreme weather conditions, or they simply come to the end of their life cycle due to the rugged marine environment in which they are deployed.  The life span of a steel ocean buoy varies greatly depending on its size and the location of its deployment, but typically ranges from one (1) to twenty-four (24) years.  Therefore, a continuing need exists to establish a contract for the manufacture and delivery of steel ocean buoys to meet the Coast Guard’s operational requirement.  The Coast Guard has procured ocean buoys through competitive contracts on a continuous basis for more than 30 years.","Q2 2023","10/30/2022","04/28/2022",""

Alliant 2 was selected in the interim but is subject to change depending on the responses received from the RFI. At this time, based on acquisition history, this is expected to be competed as unrestricted (large businesses) and not a small business set aside.

These assessments will help inform decisions such as:
 
 •	Developing mitigations for planned and actual foreign investments evaluated through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) process
 •	Developing mitigation measures necessary to address any risk to national security interests of the United States identified by risk-based analysis through the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector (TELECOM)
 •	Tracking and monitoring compliance cases and any ensuing issues as part of mitigation
 •	Restricting future acquisitions of and/or removing existing information technology hardware, software, and services from Federal networks
 •	Approving entities to participate in sensitive information sharing programs
 •	Other use cases as appropriate

In order to accomplish the work for both programs, the Contractor will develop methodologies collaboratively with other parts of the Department of Homeland Security, Federal interagency, and other homeland security partners in the public and private sector. The methodologies should be documented from both a technical (e.g. describing methods and theoretical basis) and execution (e.g. standard operating procedures and desk guides) basis. The Contractor will be responsible for maintaining the methodological documentation and updating it as necessary.
 
 2.1.2  Assessment Execution
 
 The Contractor will execute assessments based on the developed methods. These assessments will be tailored to meet appropriate decision-making processes. Execution of the assessments will include conducting necessary background research, writing risk assessment products, coordinatinon for review and approval, technical editing, and assistance in distribution the products as appropriate. Successfully executing these tasks may require the Contractor to gain access to private business intelligence services to provide the necessary data. The assessments may be both classified and unclassified as determined by the Government. These assessments will ultimately be communicated through products developed by the Contractor.
 
 2.1.3  Recommendations
 
 The Contractor will make recommendations for process improvements. This may include identifying information and data sources that could improve the quality of risk assessments, methods to decrease the timeline necessary to produce products, or identifying improved methods to communicate risk information. These recommendations will incorporate feedback received from direct observations in executing the process, as well as creating or leveraging other feedback mechanisms as appropriate.","Q4 2022","08/29/2022","08/26/2022",""

 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for administering a variety of immigration benefits including permanent resident status, work permits, naturalization (citizenship), international adoptions, student visas, Temporary Protected Status, asylum, and refugee status. Applicants make a formal request to USCIS by filing an application with an established processing fee and appropriate documentation. USCIS provides applicants with immigration and related services to support the legal and regulatory requirements of the application process through ite headquarters, regional and district offices, service centers, and application support centers. Once an applicant is approved, the applicant is issued a document, All issued documents with the exception of the Naturalization Certificate have an expiration date. Applicants must re-apply at specified intervals to renew documents and continue immigration benefits. One of USCIS' primary responsibilities is to administer and manage Application Support Centers (ASCs) and related operations. ASCs collect applicant biometric and biographical data (e.g. digital fingerprints, photographs, and signatures). the data is used to conduct criminal background checks prior to USCIS making a determination whether to grant immigration benefits to applicants. Additional support functions are likely as USCIS continues to grow and evolve. This procurement is a continuation of the Application Support Center (ASC) program established in 1997 which is currently under the Identity and Information Management Division (IIMD) within the USCIS Immigration Records and Identity Services (IRIS) Directorate of USCIS.

The Trace Laboratory also prepares required quality controlled solutions and substrates for use in testing scenarios.  In the pursuit of these goals, gas chromatography (GC) analysis is a mainstay of the analytical capabilities at the TSL. While this form of analysis is mainly used to analyze liquid samples, the capability to analyze vapor samples is critical to the characterization of volatiles as well as quality control of in-house synthesized standards. TSL recently added a new headspace GC to its capabilities which allows for volatile components of liquids and solids to be analyzed allowing for precise measurement of their purity. TSL has a need to expand the capabilities of this instrument to perform identification of unknown materials with a new high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) capability.

CBP’s facility portfolio for this project includes CBP-owned and long-term leased facilities. These facilities represent approximately 2.4 million square feet of facility space. The CBP facilities were selected as viable candidates for enhancements because the utility bill for each of these facilities exceeds $5,000 annually. CBP is interested in innovative technology solutions and management approaches for upgrading and installing equipment at these CBP facilities. The portfolio includes some of CBP’s largest facilities as well as many geographically dispersed, remote, and relatively small facilities.
 ESCOs must have experience developing and implementing ECMs, incorporating these technologies. Expression of Interest responses must therefore address CBP’s objectives for this project presented below:
 a.	Innovative solutions to reduce the cost of site travel throughout all phases of the project.
 b.	Turnkey ECMs that require minimal on-site operation and maintenance support. Proposed ECMs must be able to be easily used and maintained by onsite personnel that do not have facility management backgrounds (particularly for smaller facilities that do not have onsite professional facility managers).
 c.	Solutions that minimize O&M requirements and expenses including spare parts that are not costly and time consuming for small and remote facilities to maintain.  
 The three (3) tasks are detailed below. ESCOs shall address each task in their EOI response.
 a. ESPC ENABLE

Due to the continuous use and increased demand of canine transport, additional repairs are needed frequently. The increased costs for maintenance and frequency of repair have further reduced our ability to provide a safe, secure, and dependable transport. For these reasons, the purchase of these trailers is essential in meeting the requirement for canine transport to and from the training environments. The existing trailer infrastructure does not provide the capability of the increased canine production.  The canine transport trailers must be capable of sustaining consistent climate controlled environments to promote a healthier environment for the canines before and after training.  Additionally, the trailer should have a dual door system to improve the safety of both the canine and instructor and trainers during the loading, unloading, and staging of the canines.","Q4 2022","08/26/2022","08/16/2022",""

 Justification: The building envelope needs to be weather tight to provide a safe environment for training. Slips, trips and falls can occur on wet floor surfaces due to roof leakage. Leaks also contribute to the deterioration of the existing roof and building structure.
 Risk/Potential Impact To Personnel or Assets if Not Funded: Impact will be continued deterioration of the roof and structure contributing to mold and increased

Safety and health related data entered by users into the OSHIS from TSA forms, including injuries, illnesses, unsafe/unhealthful working conditions, facility inspections and job hazard information, trigger system workflows that include event-driven electronic notifications to each respective entity when predefined actions occur. Workflows ensure that incident and inspection items entered into OSHIS are routed and approved per TSA policy, proper reporting of workplace hazards and injuries transpire, and mitigation of identified hazards are recorded. These notifications expedite any necessary actions from each receiving entity. 
 
 At a high level the OSHIS shall: 
 - Launch unique form-dependent workflows when data is entered into the SIS, and send out notifications to individuals based on system role or profile and office locations as workflows progress. 
 - Be accessible by at least 600 facilities world-wide; available to the SIS user community 24 hours per day, seven days per week, with 98% up-time.

 Station Grays Harbor Tower Rehabilitation
 The tower is starting to show wear from exposure to high winds and continuous salt air exposure. The side paneling has holes, random areas are boarded over from past damage. The corner trim and fascia are rotted on the west facing side. The door framing is damaged. The structure is roughly 10x10x8 and the roof is 14x11 flat rolled asphalt. Tower is 75' feet tall. Repair is needed soon as possible to prevent further wind and rain damage to the structure and equipment.  
 
 Work will include removal of existing exterior trim ,siding, fascia and roof flashing. The windows may need to be temporarily removed to facilitate siding replacement. A CFR will need to be initiated once the siding is removed based upon the internal condition of the walls. Windows should be replaced depending on condition. The exterior should be painted with a high quality paint able to withstand the unique weather at this location. Total estimated cost $7500.00.

Contractor will need to be cognizant of over water work and containment of concrete sections, dust. The lighthouse will not be replaced in kind.
 
 Safety: 5 Decrepit structure well past its service life. Intense spalling, rebar failure, column failure, and unsafe access have proven the structure to be useless in maintaining an optic.
 Mission Impact: 3 The ANT cannot access the light on the lighthouse, so a temporary light is in place. The lighthouse obscures 15 degrees of the temporary light marking the channel for mariners.
 Environmental: 2 Large falling sections of spalled concrete could fall into water surrounding lighthouse.
 Political Visibility: 2 Lighthouse is seen and known by the City.
 Executability: 2 Potential roadblock includes environmental approval due to jetty being surrounded by water. However, jetty will remain in place and contractors will be required to follow best management practices.

 To align ICE with other federal Law Enforcement (LE) agencies, the additional requirement of completing and passing a polygraph examination was included during the hiring process for applicants of entry level LE positions.  In 2016, ICE OPR established the Credibility Assessment Operations Unit (CAOU) to oversee the administering of the polygraph program.  The primary mission of the CAOU is to enhance and maintain the integrity of the ICE workforce by means of an accredited polygraph examination credibility assessment process.  CAOU anticipates applicant polygraph testing to begin in the second quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2018.
 
 CAOU needs a Polygraph Case Management System (PCMS) that allows CAOU management and polygraph examiners the ability to efficiently and effectively collect and review all required information necessary to initiate, schedule, prepare for, execute, conduct, review, complete CAOU polygraph examinations, and report findings to management.
 
 CAOU seeks to optimize and enhance its mission through the introduction of services with expertise in application design, project management, database engineering, data mapping, and analysis.
